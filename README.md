## Introduction
This project consists in training several [Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZbbT5o_s2xq7LwI2y8_QtvuXZedL6tQU), in order to compare their performance and gain insight about how certain hyperparameters - such as the number of layers, filters, optimizers, loss functions - impact in the performance, by using metrics such as the overall accuracy and, mainly the ROC analysis.
